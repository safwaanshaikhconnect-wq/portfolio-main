## 🧠 Agent Memory & Log

### [2026-01-24 01:09] - Initialization
- **Action:** User requested "instantiate @[agent.md]".
- **Result:** Initialized Agent Dashboard with project roadmap and task board.
- **Analysis:** Codebase is healthy, using modern CSS techniques. The current design is strong but can be pushed further into "Premium" territory with better spacing and more vibrant gradients.
